Description: A population genetic simulator, which is able to generate synthetic datasets for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for multiple populations. The genetic distances among populations can be set according to the Fixation Index (Fst) as explained in Balding and Nichols (1995) <doi:10.1007/BF01441146>. This tool is able to simulate outlying individuals and missing SNPs can be specified. For Genome-wide association study (GWAS), disease status can be set in desired level according risk ratio.
